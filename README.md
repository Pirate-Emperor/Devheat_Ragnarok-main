5. Dash
```
## üî∑How is it possible to Predict?
```
1. Using LSTM Model for ML Model Creation

2. LSTM works by taking into consideration the workings of the neural cells in our brain.
    
    Just like those LSTM Model works by integrating a set of internal cells to perform the desired operation

3. By taking a set of actual values into consideration while predicting the next data upon them,
    
    and excluding the previous record helps in making the model both fast and efficient.

```
### üèÜFuture Scope
1. Upon considering various other features of the trained set,
   Like production efficiency, investments by the firm and many more
   we can get better predicted stock prices.
2. The above method not only increases the model accuracy and precision (AUC - ROC)
   but also helps in getting the predicatable data for longer set of future intervals
3. Adding a chatbot for user's queries.
